When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 Well, when i decide to share my code to other people for possible collaborations and/or feedbacks.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 So you’re sure you are pulling the right modifications and you’re sure not to miss something.
