How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to find the specific line and code that went wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It let you know what you’ve done time to time, see changes and even bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Pros are you don’t worry about unexpected commits and you are free to choose when.
   Cons are you get to logically think when to commit or there’s hardwork done for you even tho it just takes two clicks to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is purposely made for coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Git log to see the history of commits for that repository and git diff for selecting the compared commits using the unique id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

     I really don’t know.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For saving versions of code. So I can history of it, see bugs and even go back in case  there’s a misconcetio.
